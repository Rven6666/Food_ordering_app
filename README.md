Use 'gradle run --console=plain' or './gradlew run --console=plain' to run the application.
If this hasn't been done before it may take some time for gradle to build the application first.
There is a test member with username 'member' and password 'memberPass', and a test admin
with username 'admin' and password 'adminPass' which you may use to test the program as well as
create a new user that you can then login with and then use the application with. You may also run
'gradle build jacocoTestReport' or './gradlew build jacocoTestReport' to run the automated tests, 
then follow the information provided in the terminal to see the coverage reports.
